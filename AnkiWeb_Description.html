<b>Sample Cards Overview</b>

This template changed quite a bit from the last version and thus most of the
sample cards lost their concrete purpose. Still I would like to explain what is going
on with most cards in the following section.

<li>Sample Cards #1 #2</li>

Normal cards with an English definition as generated by the templates above. Simply
ensure you have the Yomichan pitch accent dictionary installed and that JMdict is at
the top. The first card has no example sentence, the second does. To automatically insert
the example sentence simply copy it to your clipboard before making the card.

<li>Sample Cards #3 #4</li>

Cards with additional media (screenshot and sentence audio) captured from native media.
See https://animecards.site for more information on how to do this.

<li>Sample Cards #5 #6</li>

Cards now have Japanese definitions. These are very good to switch to when you feel able to,
as they provide you with more input.

<li>Sample Cards #9 #10</li>

Showing off the hint field (where it makes sense).
In this case you have reading alternatives for 音読み and 訓読み variants,
so I put the type of reading the card covers for ambiguous words on the front.
Other words where this differentiation would make sense:

武士 (ぶし - もののふ)
海風 (かいふう - うみかぜ)
赤子 (せきし - あかご)
耳朶 (じだ - みみたぶ)
足跡 (そくせき - あしあと)
悪口 (あっこう - わるくち)

And the list goes on and on. Its important indicator to not make your cards ambiguous.

<li>Sample Cards #11 #12</li>

Another usage for the hint field. Some words appear only in certain expressions or
contexts, in those cases it makes sense to put that expression on the front as it
will be much harder to review the card without that context, and it's pretty much the
only context you see those words in.
If you are asking yourself why you wouldn't just mine the entire expression,
it's simply less convenient. Usually the expressions don't have entries in Japanese
dictionaries (as they are sorted under the word in question) and they are often not
voiced in the Japanese pod audio. Of course, you are free to handle this however you like.

<li>Sample Cards #13 #14</li>

Another usage for the hint field. Onomatopoeic words are difficult to review on
their own without context. The hint straight up serves the purpose of making those
cards easier. It also makes sense to use the hint field for other non-kanji words.
The reason you can review kanji words without a context is because the kanji themselves
carry semantic hints that make guessing the meaning not difficult at all.
Ultimately you review faster and more effectively than if you used sentence cards
and a context you are already familiar with.

<li>Sample Cards #15 #16</li>

Two more well-formed cards. These are the types of cards you should strive to make.
